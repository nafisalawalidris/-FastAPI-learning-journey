# FastAPI Learning Journey 

Welcome to my FastAPI learning journey, this repository documents my progress, projects and insights as I explore the FastAPI framework. 

## Overview

As a Data Scientist with 3 years of experience, I am expanding my skill set to include FastAPI a modern web framework for building APIs with Python. This repo will serve as a portfolio of my learning process and practical implementations.

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey as I learn and master FastAPI a powerful and efficient web framework for building APIs in Python.

## Why FastAPI?

FastAPI is known for its speed, ease of use and modern features like asynchronous programming and automatic validation. Itâ€™s an excellent tool for building high-performance APIs and it complements my background in data science by enabling me to create robust scalable APIs for data-driven applications.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the basics of FastAPI and its core features.
- Build RESTful APIs with CRUD functionality.
- Integrate databases and manage data with FastAPI.
- Implement authentication and authorisation mechanisms.
- Deploy FastAPI applications to production.
- Explore advanced features like background tasks, WebSockets and more.

## Setup and Installation

### 1. Creating a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv fastapi-env
source fastapi-env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `fastapi-env\Scripts\activate`

## 2. Installing Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn

Additional dependencies can be installed as needed:

pip install sqlalchemy pydantic jinja2 passlib httpx

## 3. Running a Basic FastAPI Application
Create a simple FastAPI application:
# main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}

Run the application using uvicorn:
uvicorn main:app --reload
