# FastAPI Learning Journey 

Welcome to my FastAPI learning journey, this repository documents my progress, projects and insights as I explore the FastAPI framework.

## Overview

As a Data Scientist with 3 years of experience, I am expanding my skill set to include FastAPI which is a modern web framework for building APIs with Python. This repo will serve as a portfolio of my learning process and practical implementations.

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey as I learn and master FastAPI a powerful and efficient web framework for building APIs in Python.

## Why FastAPI?

FastAPI is known for its speed, ease of use and modern features like asynchronous programming and automatic validation. Itâ€™s an excellent tool for building high-performance APIs and it complements my background in data science by enabling me to create robust scalable APIs for data-driven applications.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the basics of FastAPI and its core features.
- Build RESTful APIs with CRUD functionality.
- Integrate databases and manage data with FastAPI.
- Implement authentication and authorisation mechanisms.
- Deploy FastAPI applications to production.
- Explore advanced features like background tasks, WebSockets and more.

## Setup and Installation

Steps for setting up FastAPI:

1. Create a virtual environment.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run a basic FastAPI application.

## Project Structure

An example of how the project might be structured including folders for application code, tests and environment settings.

## Learning Progress

This section documents the steps in my learning journey:

- Setting up a virtual environment.
- Creating a basic FastAPI application.
- Building API endpoints and implementing CRUD operations.
- Integrating a database.
- Implementing authentication and authorisation.
- Testing and debugging.
- Deploying applications to production.
